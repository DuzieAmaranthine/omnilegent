## Description

omnilegent is a virtual book shelf web application where a user can search for and track books, store a completed library and a to-be-read library, and create a chatroom for specific topics (this will eventually be turned into a book club environment). It uses the public Google Books API for the searching implementation.

The application uses NestJS for the server side, Postgres for the database, and React for the frontend. It is deployed on heroku at [omnilegent.herokuapp.com](https://omnilegent.herokuapp.com/).

The base of the application is a NestStartApp provided by dittonjs. Please read through the [PROJECT_SETUP](/docs/PROJECT_SETUP.md) to ensure all of the tools are installed.
